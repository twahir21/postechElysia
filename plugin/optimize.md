Very good and **critical** question.  
You're already thinking like a real system designer — and that mindset will make your project **very scalable** if you plan it right. 🚀

### 📊 **Answer to your question:**

**There is no fixed number like "after 10,000 users, optimize".**  
👉 It depends on **how frequent** users hit your server and **how heavy** your database reads/writes are.

BUT from **experience** in real production:

| Users  | Optimization Needed? | Why? |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 - 1,000 | No serious optimization needed | Normal server/database setup handles it |
| 1,000 - 10,000 | Begin optimizing critical paths | Add indexes, optimize queries, cache heavy reads |
| 10,000 - 100,000 | **Must** optimize | Implement Redis caching, reduce DB hits, batch writes, avoid SELECT * |
| 100,000+ | **Major redesigns** needed | Use background jobs, queues, aggressive caching, separate read/write DBs |

---

### 🛠 **Signs you *must* optimize immediately:**
- **Queries taking > 100ms** on backend.
- **Spike in database CPU** when many users visit.
- **Too many database hits** per single page load.
- **Your app feels "laggy"** even when internet is good.
- **Error rates go up** (timeouts, slow responses).

---

### 📚 **Checklist to Scale Your Current Code:**

1. **Optimize Database Queries**
   - Always SELECT only the columns you need, not `SELECT *`.
   - Add **indexes** on most queried fields (`createdAt`, `email`, `shopId`, etc).
   - Use pagination, limits.
   
2. **Use Caching (Redis, Bun memory, etc.)**
   - Cache **common queries** (e.g., sales analytics, dashboard totals).
   - Cache **session/user info** for fast auth checks.
   - Set TTL (Time to Live) for cache to refresh automatically (e.g., every 5 mins).
   
3. **Reduce Number of Queries per API Request**
   - Combine multiple small queries into one bigger query when possible.
   - Pre-compute heavy values and store them (e.g., store total sales, don't always sum on every dashboard load).
   
4. **Global Context / In-Memory Storage (for single server)**
   - Use a global context (in Bun) to hold **common data** for fast access.
   - Good for settings, country codes, shop plans, etc.

5. **Avoid Unnecessary Writes**
   - Example: Don't update `last_seen` every time user touches server. Instead, batch update every 15min using background job.
   
6. **Asynchronous Jobs (Queue for heavy writes)**
   - When doing something heavy (e.g., generating a report), **queue it** and return quickly to user.
   - Process slowly in background.

7. **Optimize Payload Sizes**
   - Don't send 100KB JSON if user only needs 5 fields.
   - Compress responses (Bun does this efficiently already).

8. **Use typeBox instead of Zod for data validation**
- zod uses more memory and slow

9. **Remove un-used packages because packages consumes memory and costful in production**
   - use bunx depcheck to check for unused libs
   - install via bun add -d depcheck
   - remove highly memory usage libs which are not important.

### 📈 **Example When Redis Becomes Useful**
| Feature | Cache or Not? | Why? |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Dashboard total sales today | ✅ | Reduces heavy `SUM` query every page refresh |
| User session data | ✅ | Fast lookup instead of hitting database every request |
| Frequently asked products | ✅ | Changes rarely, cache for few minutes |
| Actual sales transaction insert | ❌ (No cache) | Always write real-time to database |
| Authentication (token validation) | ✅ | Cache userId/token mappings |

---

### 🧠 **Simple Rule of Thumb:**
> **If a DB value doesn't change every second → it can be cached.**  
>  
> **If a value changes very frequently → avoid caching it (or cache only very short time).**

---

### 🚀 **My advice for you (right now):**
- Up to **5,000 active users**: Just optimize your queries and use indexes properly.
- After **10,000+ active users**: Introduce Redis for read-heavy data (dashboard, auth sessions).
- Always monitor **query times** and **server CPU** — don't wait for problems.

---

### 🎯 Quick Example (how caching could help):

Instead of hitting database every time for today's sales:

```ts
const cachedTotal = await redis.get(`sales_total_${shopId}_${todayDate}`);
if (cachedTotal) return cachedTotal;

// If not found, fetch from database
const total = await db.sales.aggregate(...);
await redis.set(`sales_total_${shopId}_${todayDate}`, total, { ex: 300 }); // cache for 5min
return total;
```

**Result:**  
→ Only first user hits database.  
→ Next 1000 users get super-fast response from Redis!
